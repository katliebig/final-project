# Character creator

This is the final project of the Technigo Bootcamp in Front End Development.
We chose to do fullstack project: a character creator for an RPG that lets the user choose a race, create an avatar and fill in a character sheet.

## The tech

To build this project, we used:
- React
- Redux
- Express
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary
- CSS3
- Postman
- Trello

We built this project one feature at a time, starting with the main feature, the character creator. Once that was working, we added the option to save a character image, an open gallery, a personal gallery, a registration workflow and the character sheet. For styling and refactoring, as well as addition of new smaller features, we worked in branches. We kept a backlog in Trello that helped us keep track of all tasks.

Brief schedule
- Week 1: Cloudinary setup, creator, registration workflow, saving image
- Week 2: Open gallery, personal gallery, race page, local storage, character randomizer
- Week 3: Styling, character sheet
- Week 4: Styling, bug fixes, code cleanup
- Week 5: Pagination, not found page, FAQ
